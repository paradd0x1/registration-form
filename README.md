## Registration Form App

A small project to demonstrate my PHP learning while utilizing XAMPP and HTML/CSS.
This App allows the user to register via entering a username and a password. The PHP script
checks the database whether the entered username already exists. If not, the script will proceed 
to perform SQL query via `mysqli_query` to insert an entry into the database based on user inputs.
