## Registration Form App

A small project to demonstrate PHP learning, utilizing XAMPP and HTML/CSS.
This App allows the user to register via entering username and password. The PHP script
checks in database whether username is already registered. If not, the script will proceed 
to perform SQL query to insert an entry to the database based on user inputs.
